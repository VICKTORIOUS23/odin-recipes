    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Here you have a generic representation of a childhood favorite recipe of mine.
        A traditional Goulash recipe is quite literally just a remainder of whatever you
        have available in your pantry, but it does have a typical design, much like a website.
        In my household, here's a typical recipe path that we used.
    </p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Pasta - generally any kind will do.</li>
        <li>Ground Beef - we typically portioned our ground beef in 1 lb increments.</li>
        <li>Tomato Paste - in a pinch, ketchup after the fact is acceptable.</li>
        <li>Beans and/or corn - Controversial I know, but when you're poor you accept whatever flavor you can get.</li>
        <li>Mess around and find out. FAFO for short. Have fun with it!</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First thing you want to do is season your ground beef.</li>
        <li>Next bring a pot of water to a boil.</li>
        <li>As the water comes to temp, go ahead and start browning the ground beef. Season to taste</li>
        <li>Once the water is boiling, add pasta and salt</li>
        <li>Once your beef is browned and seasoned, add tomato paste and the other ingredients of choice</li>
        <li>Using a colander, strain the cooked pasta and add to the beef skillet.</li>
        <li>Stir all ingredients together, still seasoning to taste.</li>
        <li>Let rest and enjoy!</li>



    </ol>
